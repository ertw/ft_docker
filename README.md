## ft_docker

This project was an introduction to Docker. I had a lot of fun with the Dockerfile portion (the second part of the project), and have been using docker-compose librally ever since. 

##### Tools:
Docker, docker-machine, docker-compose, shell scripts

##### Requirements:

* Section 1 is simple docker commands
* Section 2 uses Dockerfiles to make some more interesting services

## Development setup for Mac

`brew install docker docker-machine docker-compose`
